                <p>Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction.

                    She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men.

                <p>I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step. Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke.

                    Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No. It's a short range fighter.
